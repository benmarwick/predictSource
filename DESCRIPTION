Description: A package to analyze data used to determine whether samples from multiple sources
    can be separated, to predict the sources of samples from unknown
    sources, and to evaluation the validity of those predictions. Sample data can include both
    quantitative and qualitative data. The package includes functions for creating an analysis file
    from multiple files and exploratory data analysis, as well as multivariate statistical methods to
    determine source separation, predict sources of unknown samples, and evaluate the validity of the
    predictions (principal components, classification trees, and random forests).
