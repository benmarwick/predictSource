\title{p-values for testing whether the bivariate Rb/Zr distribution is Gaussian
 at two Jemez sources.}
\format{
A matrix with 2 rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
  \item{AD.Rb}{A vector with results from the Anderson-Darling test for a
  Rb having a univariate Gaussian distribution.}
  \item{AD.Zr}{A vector with results from the Anderson-Darling test for a
  Zr having a univariate Gaussian distribution.}
  \item{SW.Rb}{A vector with results from the Shapiro-Wilk test for a
  Rb having a univariate Gaussian distribution.}
  \item{SW.Zr}{A vector with results from the Shapiro-Wilk test for a
  Zr having a univariate Gaussian distribution.}
  \item{Marida.skew}{A vector with results from the Mardia test for a
  bivariate Gaussian distribution based on skewness.}
  \item{Marida.kurtosis}{A vector with results from the Mardia test for a
  bivariate Gaussian distribution based on kurtosis.}
  }

\source{
The matrix was output from the function ps_2dPlotGauss().

\usage{
RbZr.pvalues
}
\description{
A data set containing p-values from univariate and bivariate tests.  The
labels for the rows are the codes for the Jemez sources.
