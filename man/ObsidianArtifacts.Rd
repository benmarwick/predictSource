\title{Chemical composition of obsidian artifacts}
\format{
A data frame with 91 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
  \item{Code}{A one-character variable with a code for the Jemez source identified by Shackely
  using a 2- or 3-dimensional scatterplot}
  \item{ID}{A character variable with an artificial lab ID; the first character
  is A; the remaining characters are 1:91}
  \item{Rb}{The rubidium value}
  \item{Sr}{The strontium value}
  \item{Y}{The ytterbium value}
  \item{Zr}{The zirconium value}
  \item{Nb}{The niobium value}
  }
}
\source{
The data are a random sample (30 from each of the three Jemez sources predicted by Shackely, plus
the single sample predicted from another source) from a data set on approximately 450 artifacts provided by
the state of New Mexico Office of Archaeological Studies (unpublished).

ObsidianArtifacts
}
\description{
A data set containing data on five elements from 91 obsidian artifacts from the Pojoaque Valley
in north central New Mexico.  The element presence values (parts per million) were obtained using
x-ray fluorescence at Steve Shackley's laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico (using a different
instrument than the one used to analyze the obsidian source data).
